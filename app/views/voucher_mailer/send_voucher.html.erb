  Please note that our transfer representative, from Cabo T&T Company - authorized by
  Playa Hotels & Resorts - will be waiting for you outside the terminal, wearing grey
  slacks and a black uniform shirt holding a small sign so you can recognize him. It will
  be very important; you show this confirmation to him/her to board the car.
